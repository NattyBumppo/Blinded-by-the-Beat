# Summary

This is a C++/SDL game that I made for [SEAHOP](http://www.seahop.net). An experimental application, this is a puzzle game which uses no graphics. Players must rely entirely on audio to solve the puzzle. Once solved, an answer is revealed graphically.

This project requires the .NET framework to run. 

# Controls

Without giving too much away, the game can be controlled with WASD or the arrow keys, and space.

# Credits

This application was programmed by [Nat Guy](http://www.natguy.net).
